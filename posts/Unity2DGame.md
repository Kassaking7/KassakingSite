## Everything starts here
I came up with the idea of designing a 2D game using Unity at the beginning of 2023. The reason might be I see some interesting game-designing videos or I just finished my first co-op and find myself doing something I'm not really interested in. (I mean, game is always more attracting, right?)

To start this jouney, I first take a look at some tutorial videoes at youtube. 

One good video I watched is the flip bird tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtQMytORBmM)

I don't spend too much time on learning the grammar of C# at the very first, since I feel it pretty much like C/Java.

## Basic Stuffs
##### 2023 Jan ~ Mar

My idea is making a 2D side-srcolling game, Maybe like Hollow Knight. I first collected some useful spirtes. Luckliy I found some and they are made by [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/). Since they are pixel, I do have a good time designing their property/organization in my game.

Now I get everything I need. It's time to create the character and the backgrounds in Unity.

(The screenshot is from the latest version, where lights, trashBin, etc.. all added)

The backgrounds are placed using tilemap. In this case it's easier to assign properties to them.
