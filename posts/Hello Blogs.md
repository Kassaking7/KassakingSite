## Intro
Hello, this is my first blog. I came up to writing blogs when I was doing my Unity Project. I think it would be interesting to share my thought through out my developing. I will post my new thoughts on my website regularly.

By the way. I'd like to share my [previous personal site](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~z2564wan/). I was using it to update my css/js projects ([snake games](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~z2564wan/snakegamecontent.html) and some [css projects](https://student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~z2564wan/cssprojects.html)). 

Since the web is deployed understand our university student server, and it seems I'm not allowed to use *npm install* to install frameworks like React, I designed my new website using **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** and **[Maintine](https://mantine.dev/)** and deployed using **[Vercel](https://vercel.com/)**

The code for the web site is posted in my [github](https://github.com/Kassaking7/KassakingSite)
